                <p> Dried fruit has been available for thousands of years in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Dates are one of the earliest dried fruits that were eaten. Dried fruit is made by taking the water out of the fruit by sun drying or using a special machine called a dehydrator. Since the water is removed during drying, this also means that the natural sugars in the fruit are concentrated.
                    <br>Dried fruits can be a source of antioxidants in the diet. Dried apricots and peaches are also good sources of carotenoids, which your body turns into vitamin A.
                    Prunes, raisins and apricots also contain iron.<br>Other varieties of dried fruit are also available, sometimes in candied form (sugar coated). These include mangoes, pineapples, cranberries, bananas and apples. Dried fruit has had most of the water content removed. The most common varieties are raisins, dates, prunes, figs and apricots. Dried fruit is relatively high in calories and sugar. Common dried fruits contain 38â€“66% sugar, and eating too much of them may contribute to weight gain and various health problems.<br>Some fruit is coated with sugar or syrup before being dried. Always read the package when purchasing dried fruit and avoid brands that contain added sugar.</p><br><br>
