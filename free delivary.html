        <p><b>Short-term benefits of free delivery</b><br>
           <br>
           1.   In the short-term, the greatest benefit of offering free delivery is a boost in sales.<br>
            
           2.   If shoppers already like to buy your products, free delivery for existing customers will only entice more of them to return for another purchase.<br>
            
           3.   In turn, that leads to greater order volumes and more profit.<br>

           Instead of an all-year-round standard service, you set up periodical offers on certain days, dates, periods, or times of the year.

           For example, a lot of companies offer free shipping during the holiday season. Itâ€™s a good idea to add free delivery at this time because it makes you more competitive.
           
           And consumers have also come to expect these kinds of incentives during the holidays.</p>
